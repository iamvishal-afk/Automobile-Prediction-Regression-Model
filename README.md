The Automobile Prediction Regression Model is a machine learning project that predicts automobile attributes such as price or mileage using regression algorithms. The project aims to analyze automobile datasets, clean and preprocess data, and build efficient predictive models that can help understand how different features affect vehicle performance and cost.

This project is implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, making it simple to visualize, train, and evaluate models interactively.

🚀 Features

Data loading and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data, feature scaling).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Implementation of multiple regression models using Scikit-Learn.

Model performance evaluation using metrics such as R² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Easy to customize and extend with other datasets or models.
